# Overview
I originally built this website to simply track some code that I scheduled to run daily. Once I started building the homepage, however, I realized I have much more to share. I saw the opportunity to introduce myself and my work to the world!

# Implementation
This Website is simply designed and coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is divided into a few tabs: Homepage, About, Projects, Contact, Sign In. These tabs allow me to present everything I want to display in an organized fashion. Plus, the Projects section is highly reusable, so when I have a new project to share it is very easy to add. The site is serverlessly hosted on AWS and uses several services, including Amplify, Cognito, and API Gateway.

# Details
By visiting my site you are already aware of most of the details. Visit the About section for the architecture of the site. If you would like to see the front-end code, please see the Github Repository linked below. The back-end is configured by AWS and includes many Lambda functions that change depending on the project. For security reasons and the constantly-changing nature of some projects, I will keep that code secret for now.
